# Grade
- Exercises 5/5
- Final assignment: 4/5

Late submission, but good work, so I round the final grade back up to 4! I hope you learned a lot, and will continue using Python also in the future.
Here are some quick comments about the final assignment:

# Comments:
### Documentation
- very clear documentation using markdown, code comments and docstrings.
- functions.py should also have it's own docstring.
- Tiny note on docstring formatting; the text should start on the same line with the triple-brackets.. Also use double-quotes, not single quotes.. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
- Readme could have an index / link to relevant files. Now it was a bit difficult to start browsing trough the analysis :) I of course went straight to the code graveyard coz it sounded interesting! :)

### Code
- Prefer to use the pyproj CRS class for handling projections.. Might avoid trouble in the future.
- For data exploration purposes, could first plot the mapped themes separately on static maps, before plotting the final product.

### Visuals
- Cool, multidimensional interactive map with lots of things to explore! 
- Consider putting the map online somewhere; just publish as GH-pages as we did in lesson 5 and put into your portfolio :)
- Color choice for the green party dots is very GREEN. Maybe something less neon would work better.. :D
